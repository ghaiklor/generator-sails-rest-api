/**
 * Policy Mappings
 *
 * Policies are simple functions which run before your controllers.
 * You can apply one or more policies to a given controller, or protect
 * its actions individually.
 *
 * Any policy file (e.g. `api/policies/authenticated.js`) can be accessed
 * below by its filename, minus the extension, (e.g. "authenticated")
